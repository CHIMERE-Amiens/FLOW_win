===================================================The post-Doc of LIU ======================================================================
[Update 2023.02.19]
Debug and optimasition:  aliasiong , Image-> Positife / Neagtif in EPI DOI windows. (find the current tab first then do the aliasing)


[Update 2023.01.26]
Added support for another readable format for physiological signal files
Adjusted the sampling frequency of the sensor from 500Hz to 495Hz for more accuracy

[Update 2022.12.14]
Fixed the problem that we can't open the DICOMDIR of Cambrdge, this is beacuse in this GE mechine, there is a 'KEY OBJECT DOC' type files.

[Update 2022.12.14]
Optimisation of the back ground correction for GE.  GE the phase contrasht image is build with both phase constrast image and amplitude image, so there has an ohter way to calcult the velocity. in order to fix for all the constructor, we used the indensity of phase contrast image directly. 

[Update 2022.12.12]
Added the function to save results in JSON format

[Update 2022.12.10]
Fixed the calculation of Volume curves.

[Update 2022.10.10-20]
Modify the contrast image by presing+drag wheel, in main interface and CINE-PC interface
in CINE-PC interface we can change image by roing the wheel
Auto definir image contrast by double click wheel mouse. in main interface and CINE-PC interface.

A New function that can auto do the back groud correction specifiquly for CINE-PC, faster and more correct
A new function Semi-auto do the back groud correctiong with allow us modify a lot of vraible. 

Added language option to show the names in Levels by fr. ou en., and will always used the original file name to save the file.
...

[Update 2022.10.09]
Changed the Max and Min stroke volume to Positif and negatif Stroke volume.


[Update 2022.10.09]
Added functions : we can use the drag wheel ,ouse button to adjust the contrast in main interfave and in the CINE-PC interface.
in the CINE-PC iterface dess window, auto adjust contrast by double clikcs left mouse button.

[Update 2022.10.07]
Debug: Load ROI, the calibration is nor correct because the number of VZM_zone_manu.Xverts is not stable.

[Update 2022.10.02]
Update in respiration interface:
- The variation of Pulsatility index and stroke volume average ((positif + negatif)/2) parameters with respiratory phase delay can be analyzed.
- The calculation of some parameters has been modified, and the flow curve has been interpolated before the calculation of parameters such as average and pulse volume, which reduces the processing speed but increases the accuracy
- Added Stroke volume net for the reconstruction curve
-The function of defining the respiratory interval position has been optimized. The start and end positions can be defined separately, and parameters such as the number of included respiratory periods and the average respiratory period are automatically displayed.

[Update 2022.09.30]
Added the Pulsatility index, strokevolume pos, neg, mean in the respi interval.
Debug the Mean flow calculation and vesualisation in respi interval


[Update 2022.09.29]
When chosien 'Option -> negative', the flow rate cruves will shown in red color.
In Image-signal interface, added 4 new cruves to show siganl of all cycle - Pulsatility index, Stroke volume possitife, stroke volume negative,   
Stroke volume mean


[Update 2022.09.28]
Opptimation in Charging series; so many loops in the old code; put the  loopf of tiger_time and another loop together: speed has been inoroved (22s -> 8s)
Opptimation in Series list: re-write Dicomseries_phillips.get_type, the speed has been inmproved (0.98s -> 0.61s).   


[Update 2022.09.27] Used 4 weeks total
Big Updata!!!!  i writen a new function Read_DICOMDIR to Read the DICOMDIR file. the speed can inprove 8-20 times. (used 1 mouth to write this function)
Now we can load the series list very very fast!  (22s -> 5s)

 
[Update 2022.09.05]
Debug : aliasing by image algorthem corrected
new function : csf auto de aliasing created, for correct the aliasing by analysing the mean flow.
Debug : put the Dicomdir.pro in the end to complier, or it will cause problem for the GE 

[Update 2022.06.30]
Debug BREST_REVERT: the FOV is not correct, in other phillips the FOV (ROW&COL) tag is:('0028'x, '0010'x)[0] and ('0028'x, '0011'x)[0]
but in this dicomdir the FOV is ('0028'x, '0010'x)[1] and ('0028'x, '0011'x)[1] 

[Update 2022.05.23]
Debug : Dicomdir of Miami, the number of phase image is 1000+, tigerdelay parameter is intarr type, changed to ULonarr.

[Update 2022.03.24]
Changed defeut Bpm from 70 to 1.
Fixed for Dicomdir whom cannt be loaded with the SOP Class UID '1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.11.1', defined it as a 'Normal' type.
Fixed the tab_seires of Phillips is not in order.
[Update 2022.03.22]
Debug : probleme to load GE and bruker 
        fixed GE : little probleme from last upload. 
        fixed Bruker : 1. Number of series too large (10001 etc.), Fix() is not enough so changed to Long() 
                       2. Problem to show the VENC, the unit of UPJV's Bruker is cm/s so multi 10 
                       3. Cant use Dicomdir to load the descruption of series and even some image has no tag (0008,103e), 
                          so added a fuction that can load the tag (0018,1030) as the nom series.
        fixed rebuilding :   proprite -> Plug-in: dont .reser_session 
                                                  dont Resolve_ALL
                                                  Creer file : .:flow.sav 
                             proprite -> projet : Change the name as flow.  
                          
[Update 2022.03.14]
Debug : A huge one! CHU cean acquisition cannot be loaed
        Problem 1 : For the type of Diffusion who is the RGB type images, the tag (0020,0032) image position is different with others: 
          fixed : added a test process to jump this type series

     	Problem2 : The series number is not in order, beacuse the dcm files is not in correct order 
          fixed : after created the list_series, re-order the series base on the serie_ID. 

        Problem 3 : IDLffDICOm cannot read the compressing type : JPEG Lossless, NOn-Hierarchical, process 14, which has a transfer UID : 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.70
          fixed : use 'IDLffDICOMEX' to change all the dcm files' UID to 1.2.840.10008.1.2.1, in this way IDLffDICOM can load the images
                  To use the programe to change the compressing type ask LIU, this programe needs the lisences of DicomTools.
        
        Problem 4 : The venc is showed as a negative value. beacuse for simens the venc value cannt be export with the tag as philips
          fixed : export the venc form a str value.
 
[Update 2022.02.21]
Debug : agter GE software builed , the dicomdir cannot be loaded. fixed : deleted the commende that just for test a calue in exportseries.pro

[Update 2020.10.21]
Fixed the problem that Bruker BioSpin MRI GmbH has no value of venc, the tag (0018,9014) is void, and also it's rescale intercept (0028,1052)is equal 0. but it has rescale slop (0018,1053), so if we calclue the venc = max |intensite| * recale_slop

[Update 2020.10.16]
Debug: 20201016 in dicomdir_definir, the problem is semensArea cant not find the venc, caus tab_imageType is always test the first image, all series will be define as Amplitude, so that there will have no venc. corrige tpye_image = tab_imagetype[0] to tpye_image = tab_imagetype[cpt]
